A Hybrid Cloud Computing, comprised of private and public Cloud. It can share the workload between these two clouds, which make it more flexible. Moreover, there are more data deployment options in Hybrid Cloud.

If there is a fluctuation between computing and the processing demand, then it will provide the business with the ability to predict their infrastructure, which will be able to handle the overflow.

In addition, they do not provide complete access to the data. The companies using Hybrid Cloud Computing donâ€™t have direct control over its architecture. It must create to eliminate the compatibility issues with the other clouds.

To overcome the compatibility issues one must implement the servers, local area networks, and storage devices.

With the help of virtual machines and containers, companies can create a virtualization layer. In addition, the IT companies must implement a private cloud software layer above the hypervisor to deliver the cloud services.

We have to remove all the issues and ensure for proper interoperability with the public cloud application, programming interfaces and services to run this cloud successfully.

## The Architecture of Hybrid Cloud

* The first requirement is public infrastructure as a service which is AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Drive.
* The second requirement is a private Cloud.
* The third major requirement is a Wide Area Network (WAN), which is used to connect the two environments.

## How can we Implement Hybrid Cloud?

These are ways, though you can implement Hybrid Cloud Computing:

* Individual Cloud hosts provide a complete hybrid package.
* Companies which manage their cloud themselves sign up to a public cloud service which they implement to the infrastructure.
* Different Cloud providers altogether cope up and provide both private and public services as an integrated service.
